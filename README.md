# OpenSCAD Models
This repo contains various random 3D models written in OpenSCAD. There is an overview of models below.

All `.scad` files are contained in `models`. Their accompanying `.stl` files are in the `stl` folder. 

### Speaker Mount
This model is designed to hold anything with a standard "screw hole" mount (see photo below). Right now I am using this to hold speakers on a wall using VHB
tape instead of using a screw.
